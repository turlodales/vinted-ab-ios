# 2.1.2 (2017-02-03)

This release contains the following bugfix:

- Issue #12: The iOS target in the supplied Xcode project file no longer copies extraneous files 
  as resources into the framework bundle. The set of such files included generate-docs.sh, which
  led to App Store rejections for apps that build BigInt using the project file. 
  (Thanks to @arrrnas and @wuftymerguftyguff)

No source-level changes were made.

# 2.1.1 (2016-11-23)

This release restores support for iOS 8.0 and macOS 10.9.

# 2.1.0 (2016-11-15)

This release contains the following changes:

- BigInt now uses the SipHash hashing algorithm instead of implementing its own hashing.
- The `SipHash` package has been added as a required dependency. I suggest you use a dependency manager.
- Minimum deployment targets have been bumped to iOS 9.0 and macOS 10.0 to match those of `SipHash`.
- BigInt now requires Swift 3.0.1, included in Xcode 8.1.
- The Xcode project file has been regenerated from scratch, with new names for targets and schemes.
- The bundle identifiers of frameworks generated from the Xcode project file have been changed to `hu.lorentey.BigInt.<platform>`.

# 2.0.1 (2016-11-08)

This release contains the following bugfixes:

- The Swift version number is now correctly set in all targets (PR #7 by @mAu888).
- BigInt now builds on Linux (PR #5 by @ratranqu).
- Building BigInt with the Swift Package Manager bundled with Swift 3.0.1 works correctly.

Additionally, Foundation imports that weren't actually needed were removed from sources.

# 2.0.0 (2016-09-20)

This release updates the project for Swift 3.0, including adapting the API to the new naming conventions.

Further changes:

- The behavior of `BigUInt.gcd` when one of the arguments is zero has been fixed; the result in this case is now equal to the other argument.
- `BigInt` now conforms to `Strideable`, `IntegerArithmetic`, `SignedNumber` and `AbsoluteValuable`.
- `BigUInt` now conforms to `Strideable`, `IntegerArithmetic` and `BitwiseOperations`.

# 1.3.0 (2016-03-23)

This release updates the project to require Swift 2.2 and Xcode 7.3. There have been no other changes.

# 1.2.3 (2016-01-12)

This release adds experimental support for the Swift Package Manager and Swift 2.2.
There were no source-level changes.

# 1.2.2 (2016-01-08)

This release fixes version numbers embedded in build products.

# 1.2.1 (2016-01-07)

This release simply removes the stray LICENSE.md file from iOS builds.


# 1.2.0 (2016-01-06)

With this release, BigInt supports watchOS and tvOS in addition to OS X and iOS. Deployment targets are as follows:

- OS X 10.9
- iOS 8
- watchOS 2
- tvOS 9

BigInt 1.2.0 also features support for both Carthage and CocoaPods deployments.


# 1.1.0 (2016-01-06)

`BigInt` now contains enough functionality to pretend it's a respectable big integer lib. Some of the new additions since 1.0.0:

- Conversion to/from `NSData`
- Vanilla exponentiation
- Algorithm to find the multiplicative inverse of an integer in modulo arithmetic
- An implementation of the Miller-Rabin primality test
- Support for generating random big integers
- Better support for playgrounds in Xcode
- Documentation for all public API
- Fun new calculation samples


# 1.0.0 (2016-01-04)

This is the first release of the BigInt module, providing arbitrary precision integer arithmetic operations 
in pure Swift.

Two big integer types are included: `BigUInt` and `BigInt`, the latter being the signed variant.
Both of these are Swift structs with copy-on-write value semantics, and they can be used much 
like any other integer type.

The library provides implementations for some of the most frequently useful functions on 
big integers, including

- All functionality from `Comparable` and `Hashable`
- The full set of arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`
- Addition and subtraction have variants that allow for shifting the digits of the second 
operand on the fly.
- Unsigned subtraction will trap when the result would be negative. (There are variants 
that return an overflow flag.)
- Multiplication uses brute force for numbers up to 1024 digits, then switches to Karatsuba's recursive method. 
(This limit is configurable, see `BigUInt.directMultiplicationLimit`.) 
A fused multiply-add method is also available.
- Division uses Knuth's Algorithm D, with its 3/2 digits wide quotient approximation. 
It will trap when the divisor is zero. `BigUInt.divmod` returns the quotient and
remainder at once; this is faster than calculating them separately.
- Bitwise operators: `~`, `|`, `&`, `^`, `|=`, `&=`, `^=`, plus the following read-only properties:
- `width`: the minimum number of bits required to store the integer,
- `trailingZeroes`: the number of trailing zero bits in the binary representation,
- `leadingZeroes`: the number of leading zero bits (when the last digit isn't full),
- Shift operators: `>>`, `<<`, `>>=`, `<<=`
- Left shifts need to allocate memory to extend the digit array, so it's probably not a good idea
to left shift a `BigUInt` by 2^50 bits.
- Radix conversion between `String`s and big integers up to base 36 (using repeated divisions).
- Big integers use this to implement `StringLiteralConvertible` (in base 10).
- `sqrt(n)`: The square root of an integer (using Newton's method)
- `BigUInt.gcd(n, m)`: The greatest common divisor of two integers (Stein's algorithm)
- `BigUInt.powmod(base, exponent, modulus)`: Modular exponentiation (right-to-left binary method):

The implementations are intended to be reasonably efficient, but they are unlikely to be
competitive with GMP at all, even when I happened to implement an algorithm with same asymptotic
behavior as GMP. (I haven't performed a comparison benchmark, though.)

The library has 100% unit test coverage.
